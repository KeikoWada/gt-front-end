## Planning and process
I first made user story and time schedule.
I planned to work on back-end, then front-end. After all of requirement was done, then I worked on  using third party APIs (googleMap APIs).
The time schedule helped me to make prioritize things.

## problem-solving strategy
My problem-solving strategy was to break larger problems into smaller ones that are easier to solve.
