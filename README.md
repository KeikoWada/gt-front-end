## Planning and process
I first made user stories and time schedules.
I first planned to work on the back-end of the project, followed by the front-end. After all of the requirements were done, I then worked on  using third party APIs (googleMap APIs).
The time schedule helped me prioritize things.

## problem-solving strategy
My problem-solving strategy was to break larger problems into smaller ones that are easier to solve.

## Installation instructions for any dependencies
### npm:
google-maps: Wrapper for asynchronously used Google Maps API in browser.
